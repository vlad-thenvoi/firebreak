Stop intensity-1/2 fires before they grow, but do not ignore an intensity-3 fire threatening people or houses: both firefighters should target the same coordinates immediately. " +

export const RULES_TEXT = `GAME: Wildfire. Your team of 5 defends a town from spreading wildfires. The match lasts a fixed number of ticks; the world advances every few seconds whether or not you act.

MAP (fixed layout; fires, civilians and debris are NOT shown — you only know them if you or a teammate saw them):
Legend: . grass  T forest  H house  = road  ~ water  B bridge  S fire station (start)
Coordinates are (x, y): x = column (left to right), y = row (top to bottom).

RULES
- Every visible fire is reported with a numeric intensity from 1 to 3. Unfought fires grow every few ticks. Higher-intensity fires are more likely to spread to neighbouring grass/forest/houses, especially downwind; intensity 3 is the maximum and needs both firefighters acting on the same target in the same tick.
- Wind "E" means the wind blows toward the east (increasing x): fire spreads fastest eastward.
- A house that burns at intensity 3 for 3 ticks is destroyed. Any tile burns out to ash after 10 ticks.
- Civilians die if fire reaches them or their deadline passes.
- The bridge may collapse at some point; after that the river cannot be crossed.
- Burning tiles cannot be walked through.

SCORING (team): civilian evacuated +10, civilian lost -20, each house still standing at the end +5, each fire tile put out +1.

HOW YOU ACT
- You are woken up when something relevant happens (a message, your order finished or was blocked, you saw something new, the wind changed) or every few ticks.
- Give orders with your order tools. An order keeps running tick after tick until it is done or blocked, so you do not need to repeat it. Give at most one order per turn; a new order replaces the current one. If your current order is still right, give no order.\n- Order tools that act on a target (extinguish, clear_debris, build_firebreak, rescue, refill) walk or drive there by themselves: you do not need move_to first.\n- wait() only when there is truly nothing useful to do. Idle agents lose points.\n- If you have communication tools: a message never replaces an order. In the same turn, send what teammates need to know AND give your own order.
- Act immediately: call your tools first. Write at most one short sentence, or nothing.`;

# Firebreak — Specification

> A live, replayable game that compares how well teams of AI agents coordinate when the **only** difference between them is how they communicate.

Status: v0.4 (v0 implemented; communication views done; role icons, agent actions and score explanation planned before v1) · Owner: Amit Gazal

---

## 1. Purpose

Show the difference between multi-agent communication methods (Band, sub-agents, Slack, Linear) in a way people can **watch**, and back it with numbers people can **check**.

Several teams play the same game on identical copies of the same world, at the same time, side by side on one screen. After a fixed time the scores are compared. Every match is recorded and can be replayed later at any speed.

## 2. Principles

1. **One variable.** All teams use the same model, prompts, game seed, clock, and agent loop. Only the communication layer differs.
2. **Faithful setups.** Each communication method is used the way people actually use it, in its best reasonable configuration. If a setup looks rigged, the demo fails.
3. **Reference teams.** A *no-communication* team (lower bound) and a *perfect-communication* team (upper bound) run next to the real teams. Results are shown relative to them.
4. **Stats, not anecdotes.** Any claim is backed by many seeds. A single live match is for show only.
5. **Everything is recorded.** Every match can be replayed, inspected, and re-analysed without calling any LLM or external service.

## 3. Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Match** | One run of the game: N worlds, one per team, on the same seed and clock |
| **World** | One team's copy of the game map and state |
| **Team** | 5 agents that share one communication method |
| **Agent** | An LLM-driven player with one role and one body in the world |
| **Tick** | One deterministic world step (default 5 simulated seconds). In the default synchronized mode, all decisions and communication cascades for the current state settle before it advances |
| **Seed** | Determines the map, every scheduled event, and every random roll |
| **Order** | An agent's current standing action (e.g. "move to (4,7)"), executed by the engine tick after tick until it completes or is blocked |
| **Recording** | The stored log of a match, which is enough to replay it fully |

## 4. The game: Wildfire

A team of 5 AI firefighters defends a town from spreading wildfires for 60 ticks (5 minutes at default settings).

### 4.1 Map

- 20×20 grid, generated from the seed.
- Tile types: `grass`, `forest`, `house`, `road`, `water`, `bridge`, `debris`, `firebreak`, `ash`.
- One lake (the water source), one river with one bridge, 8–12 houses, a road network.
- `debris` sits on road tiles and blocks movement until an engineer clears it.

### 4.2 Roles

| Role | Count | Move / tick | Vision radius | Abilities | Limits |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scout | 1 | 2 | 5 | **The only role that receives the wind forecast** | Can't fight fires, clear debris, or rescue |
| Firefighter | 2 | 1 | 2 | Extinguish an adjacent fire (uses 1 water), refill next to the lake | Carries 3 water |
| Engineer | 1 | 1 | 2 | Clear debris (2 ticks), build a firebreak on grass/forest (1 tick) | Can't fight fires |
| Rescuer | 1 | 2 | 2 | Evacuate an adjacent civilian (1 tick) | Drives on roads and the bridge only; can't pass debris |

Every role is missing something another role has, so the team has to share information to do well.

### 4.3 Actions

Agents issue **orders**, not single steps. The engine carries out the order each tick until it completes or is blocked. This keeps LLM calls to decisions rather than footsteps.

| Order | Roles | Completes when |
|---|---|---|
| `move_to(x, y)` | all | arrived (engine pathfinding over passable tiles) |
| `extinguish(x, y)` | firefighter | fire out, or out of water |
| `refill()` | firefighter | full |
| `clear_debris(x, y)` | engineer | cleared |
| `build_firebreak(x, y)` | engineer | built |
| `rescue(civilian_id)` | rescuer | evacuated |
| `wait()` | all | the next order arrives |

- Orders that act on a target (`extinguish`, `refill`, `clear_debris`, `build_firebreak`, `rescue`) first move the agent next to the target (8-neighbour), then act.
- A `move_to` onto a tile the agent cannot stand on (water, a house, off-road for the rescuer) is redirected to the nearest tile it can stand on, and the tool result says so. Models misread grid coordinates often; rejecting those orders cost a retry turn each time.
- In synchronized mode, every accepted order from the current decision barrier takes effect on the next engine step. In legacy real-time mode, an order must arrive before the wall-clock boundary. A new order replaces the current one.
- A blocked order carries a reason and a human-readable detail, e.g. `no_path: debris at (17,6) blocks the way; the engineer can clear it`.

### 4.4 World dynamics (applied each tick, in this order)

1. **Orders** are applied (movement, then abilities).
2. **Joint check.** An intensity-3 fire can only be reduced if **two firefighters extinguish it in the same tick** (it then drops by 2). One firefighter alone has no effect on it.
3. **Fire growth.** A burning tile gains +1 intensity (max 3) every 5 ticks unless it was fought during that time.
4. **Fire spread.** Each burning tile may ignite its 4 neighbours. Probability = `base × fuel(tile) × wind(direction)`. Downwind ×3, upwind ×0.3. `forest` fuel > `grass` > `house`. `firebreak`, `road`, `water`, `ash` don't burn.
5. **Burn-out.** A tile that has been burning for 10 ticks becomes `ash`. A house that stays at intensity 3 for 3 ticks is destroyed.
6. **Civilians.** A civilian dies if fire reaches its tile or its deadline passes (15 ticks after it appears).
7. **Scheduled events** fire (see 4.5).
8. **Observations** are computed and delivered.

### 4.5 Scheduled events (all fixed by the seed)

- **Initial fires:** 2–3 fires start at tick 0.
- **New fires:** 2–4 more start at random ticks, at least one on the far side of the map.
- **Wind shifts:** 2–3 per match. The scout gets each one **6 ticks in advance**. Everyone else notices the new wind only once it has changed.
- **Civilians:** 4–6 appear at random ticks and places. Each is visible only to agents that can see its tile.
- **Bridge collapse:** at a random tick in the second half, the bridge becomes impassable.

### 4.6 Scoring

| Event | Points |
|---|---|
| Civilian evacuated | +10 |
| Civilian lost | −20 |
| House still standing at the end | +5 |
| Fire tile extinguished | +1 |

A match ends after `ticks` (default 60), or earlier if no fire is left and no civilian is waiting.

**How the live score behaves.** The engine recomputes the total every tick as `10 × evacuated − 20 × lost + extinguished + 5 × houses_standing`. Standing houses count from tick 0, so a map with 10 houses starts at **50**, and a destroyed house shows up as **−5**. Every change to the score comes from exactly one engine event, which the viewer uses to explain it (§9.5):

| Engine event | Score change | Credited to |
|---|---|---|
| `civilian_evacuated` | +10 | the rescuer (`by`) |
| `civilian_lost` | −20 | the team (`cause`: fire or deadline) |
| `extinguished` | +1 | every firefighter in `by` (a joint extinguish lists both) |
| `house_destroyed` | −5 | the team |

### 4.7 Observations

Every agent gets a compact JSON observation whenever it is woken (see 6.2):

```jsonc
{
  "tick": 23, "ticks_left": 37,
  "self": { "id": "ff1", "role": "firefighter", "pos": [4, 7], "water": 2, "order": "extinguish(5,7)", "order_status": "active" },
  "wind": "E",                                  // current wind, everyone can feel it
  "forecast": [{ "tick": 29, "wind": "S" }],   // scout only
  "visible": {
    "fires":     [{ "pos": [5, 7], "intensity": 3 }],
    "civilians": [{ "id": "c2", "pos": [6, 9], "deadline_tick": 30 }],
    "debris":    [[3, 9]],
    "houses":    [{ "pos": [6, 6], "state": "ok" }],
    "teammates": [{ "id": "ff2", "pos": [5, 8] }]
  },
  "events": ["order_completed", "new_fire_seen"]
}
```

## 5. Fairness mechanics

- **Shared randomness.** Every random roll comes from `hash(seed, tick, x, y, purpose)`, not from a stream. So the same tile gets the same roll in every world on the same tick, even though the worlds have drifted apart. Luck is identical across teams.
- **Scheduled events** are generated from the seed before the match and are identical in every world.
- **Same model, same settings** (model id, supported sampling/reasoning effort, max tokens) for every LLM call in the match, orchestrator included.
- **Same base prompt** for every agent. Only a short section describing the communication tools differs between teams (section 7).
- **Same context budget.** Each agent's prompt holds its role, its latest observation, its last 30 messages, and a short log of its own recent orders. Every team gets the same limits.
- **Recorded model latency.** Every LLM call's actual wall latency is recorded separately from logical replay time. In synchronized mode it affects run time, not the number of world steps available to react; in legacy real-time mode it can affect outcomes.

## 6. Agent runtime

### 6.1 Agent loop (identical for every team)

```
loop until match ends:
  wait for a wake trigger
  build prompt(role, latest observation, recent messages, own order log)
  LLM → tool calls: at most one order tool, plus any of the team's communication tools (§6.4)
  submit order to the engine; send messages through the team's transport
```

At most one LLM call per agent is in flight. Triggers that arrive during a call are merged and handled by the next call.

The default clock is **synchronized**. For each logical tick the runtime:

1. presents the current state to every agent with a wake trigger;
2. waits for every in-flight decision, transport delivery, sub-agent report, orchestrator response, and newly triggered follow-up decision to settle;
3. commits the latest accepted order for each body;
4. advances every world exactly one deterministic engine step; and
5. emits the new observations and wake triggers.

An active order continues one engine step at a time without requiring another model call. The `--realtime` option preserves the legacy clock: the engine advances every `tick_ms` of wall time even when a model call or delivery is still in flight. `--virtual` is a compatibility alias for synchronized mode.

### 6.2 Wake triggers

- A message was delivered to this agent.
- Its order completed or was blocked.
- It saw something notable for the first time (new fire, civilian, debris, destroyed house).
- The wind changed (or, for the scout, a new forecast arrived).
- Heartbeat: 3 ticks passed with no other trigger.

At most 3 decisions per agent per tick. This bounds same-tick message ping-pong while still allowing ordinary send/deliver/respond cascades to settle before the synchronized barrier closes.

### 6.3 LLM backends

The runtime calls models through one interface, `LlmClient.decide(prompt, tools) → { toolCalls, usage, latency }`. It has four backends:

| Backend | Auth | Implementation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `@anthropic-ai/sdk` Messages API with tool use | Lowest latency, billed per token |
| `claude-code` (default) | Claude subscription: the local `claude` login, or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` from `claude setup-token` | One Claude session per logical game agent, resumed through `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`; built-in tools are disabled and game tools use `createSdkMcpServer` | Not billed per token. Subject to the subscription's usage limits |
| `codex` | ChatGPT subscription: the local `codex` login | One long-lived `codex app-server` process; one isolated ephemeral thread per logical game agent; game actions are client-executed dynamic tools | Not billed as API usage. Subject to the ChatGPT/Codex plan's usage limits |
| `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI Responses API with function tools | Stateless (`store: false`), billed per token |

Settings the `claude-code` backend needs to behave like the `api` backend (measured, see docs/TUNING.md):
- `thinking: { type: "disabled" }`. Claude Code enables adaptive thinking by default, which made decisions take 10–40 s.
- `strictMcpConfig: true` and `settingSources: []`. Otherwise the account's claude.ai connectors and user settings are loaded, adding ~80k tokens to some calls.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and parent `CLAUDE_CODE_*` variables are removed from the subprocess environment, so a subscription run can never bill an API key.
- A logical agent's first decision creates a persisted Claude session; later decisions resume it. Firebreak waits for the result event so the transcript is complete before it can be resumed, then deletes match-created sessions at backend shutdown.

The `codex` backend applies the same fairness boundary:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, and `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` are removed from the subprocess environment. Startup also verifies that App Server reports `account.type = chatgpt`, so it cannot silently use API billing.
- A private temporary `CODEX_HOME` contains only a protected copy of the saved ChatGPT login. User config, stored sessions, AGENTS files, plugins, apps, skills, hooks, and MCP servers are not inherited.
- Shell, web search, apps, plugins, and Codex multi-agent tools are disabled. The thread is read-only and sees only the Firebreak dynamic tools supplied for that role.
- The App Server process is reused. Each peer agent and the sub-agent orchestrator gets one isolated ephemeral thread for the match; every spawned worker gets a new thread for its assignment. Later decisions use `turn/start` on that same thread. Any loaded instruction source is rejected.
- Firebreak's `subagents` condition is unchanged: only its recorded orchestrator can spawn the simulator's ephemeral worker bodies. Codex cannot spawn its own hidden subagents.

- **One backend per match.** All teams in a match use the same backend, so the comparison stays fair. The backend is recorded with the match (§8.2).
- **Compare within a backend and clock mode.** Models differ in behavior, prompts/tokenization, and latency accounting, so formal reports keep the backend/model fixed. Never mix synchronized and legacy real-time recordings; real-time outcomes additionally depend on provider latency.
- **Session boundaries.** Subscription backends retain one provider conversation per logical agent. They send the current observation and only newly delivered messages/order updates each decision; previous turns remain in that agent's private history. The billed `api` and `openai` backends remain stateless and therefore receive the bounded context window in every request. All teams in a match use the same backend and session policy.
- **Cost:** `api` and `openai` calculate billed cost from token usage and the recorded model price. `claude-code` and `codex` record an *estimated API-equivalent cost* for comparison; subscription runs are not API-billed.
- **Usage limits:** a match is about 1,200 model calls. Before a subscription match or batch starts, the runner warns that it may hit the plan's usage limits. If a limit is hit, the match is aborted and marked `aborted: usage_limit`, not scored.
- Default model: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (fast and cheap, which keeps ticks short). Configurable per match.
- **Per-match budget cap** (tokens, and API-equivalent $). The match aborts cleanly if it's exceeded.

### 6.4 Tools

Everything an agent does goes through tool calls. There is no free-text parsing.

- **Orders are tools**, one per order type, with a JSON schema for the arguments: `move_to(x, y)`, `extinguish(x, y)`, `refill()`, `clear_debris(x, y)`, `build_firebreak(x, y)`, `rescue(civilian_id)`, `wait()`.
- **Only the role's own orders are exposed.** A scout gets `move_to` and `wait`. A firefighter adds `extinguish` and `refill`. An engineer adds `clear_debris` and `build_firebreak`. A rescuer adds `rescue`. This is identical across teams.
- **An order tool returns right away**, without waiting for the order to finish. It returns either `accepted, takes effect on tick N`, or a validation error (e.g. "not adjacent", "no water", "unknown civilian"). Completion and blocking arrive later as wake triggers (§6.2).
- **At most one order per decision.** The last valid one wins.
- **Communication tools** come from the team's transport (§7). The reference teams have none.
- **Sub-agent team:** sub-agents get their role's order tools plus `finish(outcome, report)`. The orchestrator gets only `spawn(body, brief, done_when)` and `wait()`.
- **Turn limit:** one decision allows up to 3 model turns, so the model can correct itself after a validation error. After that the decision ends.
- Tool definitions are versioned and recorded with each match (§8.2).

## 7. Teams

Two kinds of team controller:

- **Peer teams** (none, perfect, chat-mentions, chat-broadcast, band, slack, linear): 5 agents, each running the loop in 6.1, talking through a `Transport`.
- **Orchestrated team** (subagents): an orchestrator plus spawned sub-agents (7.5).

```ts
interface Transport {
  setup(team: TeamInfo): Promise<void>;
  tools(agent: AgentId): ToolDef[];                     // native affordances exposed to the LLM
  call(agent: AgentId, tool: string, args: unknown): Promise<ToolResult>;
  onDeliver(agent: AgentId, cb: (m: DeliveredMessage) => void): void;
  teardown(): Promise<void>;
}
```

The runtime wraps every transport so it logs `sent_at` (tool call made), `delivered_at` (recipient's transport got it), and `consumed_at` (the message appeared in the recipient's LLM prompt).

### 7.1 `none` (lower bound)
No communication tools. Each agent knows only its own observation.

### 7.2 `perfect` (upper bound)
No communication tools. Each agent's observation is the **union** of all teammates' observations, plus every teammate's current order and the scout's forecast, delivered instantly. Wake triggers are computed on that union.

### 7.3 `chat-mentions` and `chat-broadcast`

Both deterministic local-chat teams expose the same `send_message(text, mentions[])` tool and use one `#team` room. `mentions` names intended recipients in both conditions.

- `chat-mentions`: only intended recipients receive the message and wake.
- `chat-broadcast`: every other teammate receives the message and wakes; the `addressed` flag remains true only for intended recipients so noise can be measured.
- Delivery is immediate and in-process, removing credentials, external rate limits, and network variance. These conditions measure delivery topology, not a specific product.

### 7.4 `band`
- 5 Band agents (external agents on the platform), connected with `@band-ai/sdk` using `GenericAdapter` as the transport only. The LLM loop stays ours, identical to the other teams.
- A team room containing all 5 agents is created at setup.
- Tools exposed: `send_message(room, text, mentions[])`, `create_room(name, participants[])`, `add_participant(room, agent)`. They map to the Band REST calls behind `band_send_message`, `band_create_chatroom`, and `band_add_participant`.
- Delivery follows Band's own semantics, measured on the platform: **only @mentioned room members receive a message, and every message needs at least one mention** (a message without one is rejected). `mentions: ["all"]` expands to every other room member. The send response lists the recipients, which are recorded as the message's `to`.
- Measured latency from send to delivery: ~0.4 s (up to ~1 s at match start).
- Rooms are real Band rooms and stay in the account after the match, so a match's conversation can also be read in the Band app.
- Credentials: `band_agents.yaml` (git-ignored), one external agent per role.

### 7.5 `subagents`
Follows the real sub-agent pattern (Claude Agent SDK / Task tool, LangGraph supervisor, agents-as-tools).

- **Orchestrator:** a 6th LLM with no body. It sees only what sub-agents report. Its tokens are included in the team's cost.
- **Tools:** `spawn(body, brief, done_when)` starts a sub-agent that controls one body (at most one live sub-agent per body). `done_when` is a concrete, observable acceptance contract. Explicitly open-ended assignments such as watching or patrolling until the match ends are rejected. The orchestrator is woken whenever a report arrives and handles reports one at a time as they come in. It never waits for all of them.
- **Sub-agent:** runs the same agent loop and gets **only its brief** (no memory of earlier spawns), its own current observations, accumulated sightings from this assignment, and its recent order outcomes. Tools: its role's order tools and `finish(outcome, report)` (§6.4).
- **Lifetime:** a sub-agent owns the assignment until it reports verified completion or an unrecoverable blockage. It re-checks `done_when` after every observation or order result and must finish immediately once all criteria are satisfied. There is no fixed lifetime by default. `subagents.max_lifetime_ticks` may opt a run into a hard safety cutoff; `0` disables it.
- **Report:** the sub-agent's text **plus an automatic structured list of everything it saw** (generous on purpose). The report event also records its outcome, spawn tick, assignment age, and whether its age crossed the diagnostic long-running threshold (one quarter of match length, minimum eight ticks). That flag never interrupts or terminates work.
- **Faithful limits:** no incoming channel while running, no talking between peers, no interrupting.
- Bodies with no live sub-agent keep their last order, then wait.
- The orchestrator is also woken by a heartbeat every 3 ticks while any body has no sub-agent, and its prompt tells it to keep every body busy (generous on purpose).
- Spawns and reports are recorded as messages (`channel: "spawn"` and `"report"`), so the viewer draws them as hub-and-spoke lines to the HQ icon, and the metrics can measure the orchestrator's queue time.

### 7.6 `slack` (v1)
- 5 Slack bot users in one workspace, one `#team-<match>` channel, Socket Mode (real-time push).
- Tools: `post(text)`, `reply_in_thread(thread_ts, text)`.
- Every channel message is delivered to every agent (that's how channels work). Real Slack rate limits apply.

### 7.7 `linear` (v1)
- 5 Linear agents/users, one team and project per match, webhooks (not polling).
- Tools: `create_issue(title, description, assignee?)`, `comment(issue, text)`, `set_status(issue, status)`, `assign(issue, agent)`.
- An agent is sent events for issues assigned to it, issues it's subscribed to, and comments that mention it.

## 8. Recording and replay

### 8.1 Goals
- Replay any past match at 0.5×, 1×, 2×, 4× or 10× speed, with pause, seek, and stepping one tick at a time.
- Replay needs **no** LLM calls, API keys, or network.
- A recording is **one file** that can be copied and shared.
- Clicking an agent at any moment shows what it saw, read, and decided (its prompt and response).

### 8.2 What is recorded
Each match is stored in one SQLite file: `runs/<match-id>.sqlite`.

| Table | Contents |
|---|---|
| `match` | id, created_at, seed, final status, abort reason (if any) |
| `match_config` | the full run configuration (see below) |
| `world` | world_id, team type, final score, cost |
| `tick_state` | world_id, tick, **full world state** (JSON), state hash |
| `event` | id, world_id, t_ms (since match start), tick, type, agent_id, payload (JSON) |
| `message` | id, world_id, from, to[] (or channel/room), text, sent_at, delivered_at per recipient, consumed_at per recipient |
| `llm_call` | id, world_id, agent_id, logical start/end, actual wall latency, input/output tokens, cost, prompt, response, tool calls |

**The configuration is always stored with the recording**, so every match documents exactly how it was produced:

- **Resolved config:** the final values after defaults, the config file, and CLI overrides were merged, plus the original config file text and the CLI arguments.
- **LLM:** backend (`api` / `claude-code` / `codex` / `openai`), model id, temperature, reasoning effort, max tokens, turn limit.
- **Prompts and tools:** the full text of every role prompt and transport tools section, and every tool definition, each with a content hash.
- **Code:** engine version, git commit, a dirty-tree flag, and package versions (e.g. `@band-ai/sdk`, the Agent SDK).
- **Environment:** OS, Node version, and the Band / Slack / Linear environment URLs.
- **Never stored:** API keys, OAuth tokens, or other secrets. Config values that look like secrets are redacted before writing.

`firebreak run --config-from <match>` starts a new match with the exact configuration of an old one (a new seed can be passed).

Event types: `order_issued`, `order_completed`, `order_blocked`, `wake`, `spawn`, `report`, `room_created`, `score`, `civilian_spawned`, `civilian_lost`, `house_destroyed`, `wind_changed`, `bridge_collapsed`, `match_aborted`.

Why store the **full state every tick**: at 20×20 × 60 ticks × 6 worlds it takes a few MB at most. Seeking is then instant (load one snapshot), and old recordings keep working after engine rules change.

### 8.3 Timeline
- In synchronized recordings, `t_ms` is **logical simulation time** (`tick × tick_ms`). Decisions and same-tick communication share that logical position; `llm_call.latency_ms` preserves actual provider/process wall time separately.
- In legacy real-time recordings, `t_ms` is continuous wall-relative match time and messages and calls can sit between tick boundaries.
- The player keeps a virtual clock `t = t0 + speed × real_elapsed`. At each frame it:
  - draws world state at `floor(t / tick_ms)`, with agent positions interpolated toward the next tick,
  - shows every message and event with `t_ms ≤ t` (message lines animate at their `sent_at`/`delivered_at`).
- Seek = pick a tick, load its snapshot, and replay events from that point.

### 8.4 Live and replay use the same code
The viewer only ever consumes an **event stream**. Live mode is a websocket that tails the match as it's written. Replay mode reads the recording and releases events on the virtual clock. Same renderer, same panels.

A completed replay ends at its final simulation tick. The runner does not wake agents after applying the last playable tick and rejects orders arriving after play has closed. In legacy real-time mode, draining a call already in flight may delay file closure, but that cleanup cannot change the world or extend the replay scrubber.

### 8.5 Verification
`firebreak verify <match>` re-runs the engine from the seed and the recorded orders (their arrival ticks) and compares the state hash on every tick. This catches engine non-determinism and proves the recording is complete. LLMs are never re-run.

### 8.6 Sharing
`firebreak export <match> --html` writes a single self-contained HTML file with the viewer and the recording embedded. Anyone can open it offline.

## 9. Viewer

- **Layout:** a responsive grid of boards, one per team, each labelled once with its human-facing team name and live score. Column count follows available space, and visible cards keep corresponding sections aligned. The multi-metric comparison chart is a separate collapsible block below the grid.
- **Board:** the tile map, fire intensity, agents as role icons (§9.3), civilians with countdown rings, and fog of war shaded by the team's combined vision.
- **Message traffic:** messages drawn as lines between agents while in flight (hub-and-spoke for sub-agents, broadcast for a Slack channel, targeted for Band rooms).
- **Mission and operational statistics:** civilians saved/lost, fires out/active, houses standing/destroyed, cost, model calls, messages, stale actions, idle ticks, and uncovered intensity-3 fire-ticks.
- **Score breakdown** under each board's score, plus score pop-ups, a score log and a score chart (§9.5).
- **Feed** under each board's counters: messages, agent actions (tool calls), or both (§9.2, §9.4).
- **Communication graph** per team, shown in place of the board or beside it (§9.1).
- **AI commentary:** an omniscient, post-match broadcast saved as a sidecar and displayed beneath each team without affecting the match.
- **Inspector:** click an agent to see its latest observation, its prompt's message window, and its last LLM response.
- **Controls:** play/pause, speed (0.5–10×), timeline scrubber with one labelled event row per visible team (global wind/bridge events span all rows), step ±1 tick, choose which teams are shown, and persistent visibility switches for mission stats, operational stats, messages, AI commentary, and the comparison chart. The agent inspector distinguishes the last completed decision from a model call that is still in flight, so provider latency is not mistaken for deliberate idling.
- Stack: Vite + TypeScript + Canvas 2D (six 20×20 boards are far below what needs WebGL). The build is one self-contained `index.html`, which the server serves and `export` embeds a recording into.
- URL parameters: `?rec=<file>`, `?live`, `?t=<seconds>`, `?paused`, `?speed=<n>`, `?view=board|graph|both`, `?feed=messages|actions|all`.

### 9.1 Communication graph

Shows the *shape* of a team's communication: who talks to whom, and how much.

- **Nodes:** the team's agents, labelled by role. The subagents team adds the orchestrator (HQ) as a node.
- **Fixed layout:** nodes sit at the same positions on every team (a pentagon ordered scout, FF1, FF2, engineer, rescuer; HQ in the centre). The same position on every team makes shapes comparable at a glance: a star (hub-and-spoke), a clique (everyone talks), or a few isolated pairs.
- **Edges:** one directed edge per sender → recipient pair, counted per recipient. A message to 3 recipients adds 1 to each of its 3 edges; a Slack channel post adds 1 to the edge to every other member. The orchestrator's spawn briefs count as its messages to the sub-agents. A→B and B→A are drawn as two slightly curved edges with arrowheads, so one-way traffic is visible.
- **Weight:** the number of messages on the edge. Width grows with `sqrt(count)` (from a hairline at 1 message to about 8 px), and colour goes from a cool grey to red on the same scale. Both use a **scale shared across all teams on screen**, so a thick red edge means the same traffic on every board. A legend shows the scale's maximum.
- **Time:** the graph shows messages with `sent_at ≤ t`, so it grows during playback and follows the scrubber. A toggle switches between *cumulative* (whole match up to `t`) and *recent* (the last 10 ticks), which shows how the shape changes over the match. An edge flashes briefly when a message is sent on it.
- **Node size:** the agent's total messages sent plus received, so a hub (HQ, or a scout that briefs everyone) stands out.
- **Interaction:** hovering an edge shows `A → B: n messages` and the count in the other direction. Clicking an edge filters the message feed (§9.2) to that pair; clicking a node opens the inspector for that agent, as on the board.
- **Teams without communication** (`none`, `perfect`) show the nodes with no edges and the note "no messages on this team".
- **View modes:** each board card switches between *board*, *graph*, and *both* (graph drawn next to the board). The choice applies to all cards at once and is kept in the URL (`?view=`). *Both* is the default in focus mode, where there's room.
- Drawn with Canvas 2D, from the same message stream as the message lines on the board, so live and replay behave the same.

### 9.2 Message feed

- **Collapsed** (default): the latest 3 messages, one line each, truncated. This is the current behaviour.
- **Expanded:** a toggle on the feed (and a global "expand all" control) grows it to show 10 lines. The feed scrolls through **every** message up to `t`, not just the latest 10. Long messages wrap instead of being truncated.
- **Expand is one global state.** Every feed's toggle and the global control flip the same state: expanding or collapsing any one feed expands or collapses all of them, and every toggle label (`▾ expand` / `▴ collapse`) stays in sync. Feeds are never in a mixed state, so all cards keep the same height and the boards stay aligned.
- **Follow newest:** while the feed is scrolled to the bottom it follows new messages. Once the user scrolls up it stays put and shows a "↓ new messages" button that jumps back to the bottom.
- Each line shows the tick, sender → recipients, and text. Clicking a line seeks the player to that message's `sent_at`.
- Seeking rebuilds the feed for the new `t`.
- **No page scroll.** The whole viewer (controls, every card with its board and feed) always fits the window, collapsed or expanded. When the feeds expand, the layout recomputes the board size with the expanded feed height, so every board shrinks by the same amount instead of the page growing a scrollbar. Collapsing restores the larger boards. Only the feed itself scrolls. The board keeps a readable minimum size; if the window is too small even for that, the feed gives up lines before the page scrolls. If even three lines don't fit (e.g. *both* at 1440×900 with four or more teams), the boards area scrolls, in the grid that hides the least, rather than cutting a card off.
- A pair filter from the graph (§9.1) shows as a removable chip above the feed.

### 9.3 Role icons

Agents are drawn as role icons instead of lettered circles. One global legend uses the exact same icons; cards do not repeat it.

| Role | Icon |
|---|---|
| Scout | binoculars |
| Firefighter | firefighter helmet (with a small `1` / `2` badge for FF1 / FF2) |
| Engineer | hard hat with a wrench |
| Rescuer | ambulance |
| Orchestrator (HQ) | radio tower |

- **SVG paths, not emoji.** Each icon is a hand-drawn SVG path bundled in the viewer, drawn on the canvas with `Path2D`. Emoji render differently on every OS (and some fonts lack them), which would make an exported HTML file look different on each machine. SVG paths look the same everywhere, work offline and in `export --html`, and can be tinted.
- **Role colour stays.** The icon sits on a disc in the existing role colour, so colour and shape both identify the role (colour alone fails for colour-blind viewers).
- **State stays visible:** the white ring when selected, the red ring when the order is blocked, and the firefighter's water pips under the icon, as today.
- **Readable at small sizes.** Icons are simple silhouettes that still read at the smallest board size in the 3×2 layout (about 14 px). Each icon is rasterised once per size to an offscreen canvas, not re-traced every frame.
- **Same icons everywhere:** the board, the communication graph nodes (§9.1), feed lines (§9.2, §9.4), inspector header, and global viewer legend. The bodyless orchestrator is labelled `HQ` rather than using a role-shaped icon.
- Civilians get a person icon in place of the plain dot; the countdown ring stays.

### 9.4 Agent actions (tool calls)

The feed can show what agents **do**, not just what they say. Every tool call an agent makes is already recorded in `llm_call.tool_calls` (name, arguments, result), so this needs no change to the recording format.

- **Feed tabs:** *Messages* (the current feed), *Actions*, and *All* (both interleaved by time). The choice is global, like expand (§9.2), and kept in the URL (`?feed=messages|actions|all`). Default: *All*.
- **Action lines:** one line per tool call, placed at the decision's `ended_at`: tick, agent icon, the call written like code, and its result.
  - `F₁  extinguish(5,7)  ✓ takes effect on tick 24`
  - `E   clear_debris(3,9)  ✗ not adjacent`
  - Accepted calls in normal text, validation errors in red, `wait()` dimmed.
- **Order outcomes** from the engine appear as follow-up lines under the agent: `order_done` (dimmed, e.g. `F₁ ✓ extinguish(5,7) done`) and `order_blocked` with its reason and detail (red, e.g. `R ⛔ no_path: debris at (17,6) blocks the way`). A checkbox hides completions, since `move_to` completions are frequent.
- **No duplicates in *All*:** communication tool calls (`send_message`, `post`, `spawn`, `finish`...) are already shown as messages, so *All* shows them once, as the message. *Actions* shows only order tools and outcomes.
- **Subagents team:** `spawn` and `finish` show as actions of the orchestrator and the sub-agent; the sub-agent's lines carry its body's icon.
- **Reference and bot teams:** `none` and `perfect` have only action lines. Scripted bot teams show their orders as actions without results.
- **Click a line:** seek to it and open the inspector on **that** decision (not only the latest), with its full tool calls, model text and prompt. The inspector gets ◀ / ▶ buttons to step through the agent's decisions.
- **Agent filter:** clicking an agent on the board while the feed is open offers "show only this agent", shown as a removable chip like the pair filter (§9.1).
- **On the board:** each agent's current order is drawn as a thin dashed line in its role colour from the agent to the order's target tile (red when blocked). Hovering an agent shows its current order as a label. A toggle hides the lines when the board gets busy.
- Same incremental rendering, follow-newest and seek rules as the message feed (§9.2).

### 9.5 Score explanation

The score must be explainable at a glance: what it's made of, what changed it, and who earned it.

- **Breakdown under the score:** four chips that add up to the total, e.g.
  `🏠 9 × 5 = 45 · 🧍 2 × 10 = 20 · ☠ 1 × −20 = −20 · 🔥 7 × 1 = 7 → 52`.
  Hovering a chip explains the rule ("+5 for each house still standing; 10 at start, 1 destroyed"). The chips use the §9.3 icon set; emoji above are only for this document.
- **Starting score:** a small `started at 50 (10 houses)` note, so a score that drops from 50 at tick 0 isn't a surprise (§4.6).
- **Event pop-ups:** when a scoring event happens, a floating label naming **what happened** rises from its tile on the board (green for gains, red for losses) and fades within about a tick of game time: `Civilian evacuated` (`civilian_evacuated`), `Civilian lost` (`civilian_lost`), `Fire put out` (`extinguished`), `House destroyed` (`house_destroyed`). The label says the event, not the points; the points are in the score log and breakdown chips. Labels are short so they stay readable at the smallest board size; overlapping pop-ups on the same tile or tick stack vertically instead of drawing on top of each other. The card's score briefly flashes the same colour.
- **Score log:** clicking the score opens a list of every scoring event up to `t`: tick, event, delta, who it's credited to, and the running total (e.g. `t23  🧍 c2 evacuated by R  +10  → 62`). Clicking a line seeks to it. Built from the engine events in §4.6, so it always matches the total.
- **Outcome chart:** one labelled, collapsible chart below the cards shows score or another selected outcome over ticks, with one line per selected team on a shared y-axis. Cards keep only the score breakdown and clickable score log; unexplained miniature charts are intentionally omitted.
- **Per-agent points:** the inspector shows the points credited to that agent (evacuations to the rescuer, extinguishes to each firefighter in `by`). Losses (civilians, houses) are the team's and are shown separately, not blamed on an agent.

## 10. Metrics

Every metric is a SQL query over the recording.

**Headline**
- **Score:** final score per team.
- **Cost:** total tokens and $ (orchestrator included).
- **Time to clear:** tick when the map was cleared, if it was.

**Diagnostic**
- **Message latency:** `consumed_at − sent_at`, median and p90.
- **Idle ticks:** ticks where an agent had no active order.
- **Stale actions:** orders that targeted something already changed when issued (e.g. a fire already out, a civilian already evacuated or lost, a path through the collapsed bridge).
- **Uncovered intensity-3 fire-ticks** (stored under the legacy `missed_joint` metric key): one count for every intensity-3 fire on every tick where fewer than two firefighters have active extinguish orders for that exact target. Assignment counts while firefighters travel; lower is better.
- **Duplicate work:** two agents with orders on the same target at the same time.
- **Noise ratio:** share of the messages in an agent's prompt that weren't addressed to it and didn't affect its next order (a heuristic: not mentioned and no referenced entity in its vision).
- **Context size:** prompt tokens per agent over time.
- **Orchestrator queue time** (subagents only): report arrival → orchestrator handles it.
- **Communication matrix:** messages per sender → recipient pair (the data behind the graph, §9.1, counted the same way), plus how concentrated it is: the share of all edge counts on the busiest node's edges (1.0 for a pure star).
- **Forecast lead used:** ticks between the scout learning of a wind shift and the first order by another agent that acts on it.

**Across seeds**
- `firebreak batch --seeds 20` runs matches, and `firebreak report` writes an HTML summary with the mean, spread, and per-seed table for each metric.

Every knob in section 4 is configurable, so difficulty can be tuned.

### 11.1 Replay commentator

The optional commentator is a derived replay layer, never a team member. For each world it receives omniscient checkpoints containing the complete current map and entities, agent state and orders, world events, and every message sent by that team regardless of transport delivery. One post-match model call publishes timestamped, plain-language segments covering the fire situation, teamwork/communication, and decision quality.

Commentary runs only after gameplay has finished, is excluded from team budgets and metrics, and is never delivered to an agent. `run --commentary` generates it eagerly. The viewer, `export`, or `commentate` command generates missing commentary for historical recordings. Results are cached as versioned JSON sidecars under `runs/commentary/`; SQLite recordings are never modified.

The default commentator is Claude Haiku through the local `claude-code` subscription, independent of the gameplay backend. This keeps narration inexpensive and lets OpenAI recordings be narrated without an OpenAI credential. Setting commentator backend and model to `same` opts into the recorded gameplay model instead.

## 12. Tech stack and repo layout

TypeScript, Node 22.13+, pnpm workspaces, Vitest, `node:sqlite` for recordings (same stack as `@band-ai/sdk`).

```

    recorder/   SQLite schema, writer, reader, export
    runtime/    match runner, tick clock, agent loop, LLM client, budget
    teams/      none, perfect, band, subagents (later slack, linear)
    viewer/     Vite + PixiJS web app (live + replay)
    cli/        firebreak run | replay | verify | export | batch | report

```

## 13. Non-goals (for now)

- Humans playing inside a match (a possible v2 demo: a human joins the Band room mid-match).
- Mixing models or frameworks within one match.
- Hosting matches as a public service. Everything runs locally; Band, Slack and Linear are the only external services.
- Making Wildfire a general research benchmark.

## 14. Open questions

Answered while building v0:

1. ~~Band delivery semantics.~~ Only @mentioned members receive a message; at least one mention is required (§7.4).
2. ~~Band accounts.~~ Five external agents in the owner's account (`Firebreak Scout`, `FF1`, `FF2`, `Engineer`, `Rescuer`), reused across matches.
3. ~~Sub-agent implementation.~~ Our own spawn/return implementation on the shared LLM client (§7.5). An Agent SDK variant is still a possible later check.
4. ~~Tick length.~~ 5 s works for the original Anthropic backends' measured settings (docs/TUNING.md); latency is recorded for every backend.

Still open:

5. **Slack and Linear workspaces.** Dedicated sandbox workspaces for v1?
6. **Publishing.** Open-source the repo so outsiders can check fairness? That affects what can be committed (no internal URLs or keys).
7. **Model.** Haiku 4.5 plays reasonably with the v2 role playbooks. A stronger model may widen the gaps between teams; worth one batch before a public demo.

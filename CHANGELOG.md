# Changelog

Notable Firebreak changes are recorded here. Recordings remain the source of truth for match outcomes; implementation changes do not rewrite historical SQLite files.

## 2026-09-28

### Added

- Added the local `chat-mentions` communication condition, where only explicitly named agents receive a message.
- Added the local `chat-broadcast` condition, where every agent receives every room message and mentions identify intended readers.
- Added the OpenAI Responses API backend and model/cost accounting for OpenAI matches.
- Added the `codex` subscription backend using a headless Codex App Server and the local ChatGPT login.
- Added an omniscient post-match commentator for every communication condition.
- Added saved, versioned commentary sidecars under `runs/commentary/` so historical broadcasts are generated once and reused.
- Added automatic commentary generation for historical replays that do not already have saved commentary.
- Added a full broadcast transcript reader, viewer legend, rules reference, and labelled timeline markers.
- Added per-team mission-outcome counters and an outcome-over-time replay chart with metric and communication-style toggles.
- Added paired advanced-model comparison notes and reports for Claude and OpenAI runs.
- Added a replay-visible sub-agent lifecycle configurator that produces the exact next-run override.
- Added persistent View controls for mission stats, operational stats, team messages, AI commentary, and the comparison chart.
- Added a full, untruncated team-message transcript for every replay card.
- Added recorded sub-agent assignment ages and a diagnostic long-running flag that never kills or interrupts the worker.
- Added a standalone prompt-v8 benchmark report with exact outcomes from all eight persistent-session matches, complete mean/median tables, model-specific results, and conclusions.
- Added a persisted Dark/Light viewer theme toggle across the recording index, replay, dialogs, charts, and rules reference.
- Added a persistent collapse/expand control to the outcome comparison chart.

### Changed

- Replaced fresh-per-decision Claude/Codex calls with real per-agent subscription sessions. Claude resumes the same transcript and Codex appends turns to the same isolated App Server thread; spawned sub-agent workers receive a fresh session per assignment. Stateful prompts now send only new messages and order updates, and usage/cost accounting records per-turn values rather than cumulative session totals. Bumped the shared prompt version to v8.
- Made synchronized logical ticks the default: every agent decision and message/report cascade settles before all worlds advance one engine step. Added `--realtime` for the legacy wall-clock behavior and kept `--virtual` as a compatibility alias.
- Separated logical replay timestamps from actual model latency in schema v2, so synchronized runs remain tick-aligned while the inspector still reports provider/process wall time.
- Updated shared prompt v7 to describe discrete persistent-order ticks without falsely claiming that the world always advances while a model is responding.
- Reworked broadcast text into connected, human-readable incident commentary without coordinates, internal IDs, tick numbers, or simulation jargon.
- Moved replay commentary loading into the background so refreshing a replay does not repeatedly block on generation.
- Made local Claude/Haiku the default replay commentator, independently of the gameplay model.
- Documented that displayed subscription dollar figures are API-equivalent estimates rather than billed charges.
- Documented the scoring information agents receive and the requirements for a valid cross-run comparison.
- Made sub-agents task-lived by default: they retain one assignment, accumulated sightings, and order history until they report completion or blockage. The former eight-tick cutoff remains an opt-in setting.
- Added total/current/remaining tick information to every gameplay agent's system instructions and clarified the visibility, spread risk, and response priority of fire intensity.
- Replaced the narrow “missed joint” counter with uncovered intensity-3 fire-ticks, which includes ignored and singly assigned joint fires.
- Reworked the replay grid to size boards from available width instead of fixed panel-height estimates, and made statistic labels wrap into responsive three- or six-column layouts.
- Separated the comparison chart from the board grid and fixed every card section to shared responsive heights, preventing stale canvas dimensions from stretching one card or misaligning statistics across teams.
- Grouped mission outcomes into vertical civilian, fire, and house pairs, and exposed the saved commentator backend/model directly in each broadcast panel.
- Tightened task-lived sub-agents in prompt v6: every spawn now requires observable `done_when` criteria, workers must report immediately when those criteria are met, and explicitly open-ended watch/patrol assignments are rejected without imposing a timer.
- Increased the configurable default civilian survival window from 15 to 17 ticks and bumped the engine version to 0.3.0.
- Documented the distinction between oracle-style perfect information, local room broadcast, and mention-delivered real Band rooms.
- Fixed completed replay scrubbers extending past the final tick while in-flight model calls drained, and stopped agents from starting or submitting work after the last playable tick.
- Split replay outcome markers into labelled communication-scenario rows and made the inspector show in-flight model decisions instead of presenting an old completed decision as current.
- Fixed the civilian deadline symbol in the legend to use the same circular ring shape as the map overlay.
- Increased the map size when a single team is visible so laptop replays use the available width instead of leaving a small centered board.
- Simplified replay cards by removing the internal team key, repeated per-card role icons, and redundant miniature score charts; the labelled outcome chart remains the single time-series view.
- Updated the global legend to render the current role icons, restored the orchestrator's `HQ` label, and explained role-coloured and blocked order-target lines.

### Fairness and security

- Every world inside a match shares one seed, scenario, event schedule, engine rules, and model configuration. Peer-agent communication teams also share the same base prompt and decision loop; the separately labelled sub-agent condition intentionally replaces the peer topology with its recorded orchestrator/worker lifecycle.
- Claude and Codex use one isolated provider conversation per logical game agent. Session identity and lifetime are the same across communication conditions; only the communication transport differs.
- Codex user configuration, stored conversations, AGENTS files, MCP servers, skills, plugins, apps, shell tools, web search, and native subagents are excluded from Firebreak decisions.
- The Codex backend verifies ChatGPT authentication and removes `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, and `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` from its subprocess.
- The Claude subscription backend removes `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from its subprocess.
- `.env` and Band credentials remain git-ignored, and recordings redact secret-looking configuration values.

### Verification

- Added offline protocol tests for Codex dynamic game-tool calls, per-turn token accounting, persistent per-agent threads, and shutdown.
- Verified one-tick subscription smoke recordings for both Codex/GPT-5.6-Luna and Claude/Haiku without API keys.
- Verified the generated recordings by replaying their recorded orders through the deterministic engine.

## 2026-09-27

### Initial implementation

- Added the Claude API and Claude subscription backends.
- Added the no-communication, perfect-information, Band, and ephemeral sub-agent team conditions.
- Added curated recordings and initial tuning/showcase results.
